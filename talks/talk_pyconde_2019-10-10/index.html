# What is a Call Right?
## Example: Value of a Gold Coin

![coin](img/coin.png)
![coinvalue](draw/coin-value.svg)

- Current value of the gold coin is about 680€
- Gold price may further increase, but could also fall

---

# What is a Call Right?
## Future Scenarios of the Coin Value

![drawing](draw/monte-carlo.svg)

- Simulation model of the future coin value
- Each line is a possible future scenario, called "path"

---

# What is a Call Right?
## I don't want the Coin to loose Value

| Scenario         | What I want         |   |
|------------------|---------------------|---|
| Always           | Keep the coin       |![coinintable](img/coin.png)|
| Coin value rises | Participate         |![coinintable](draw/smiley_happy.svg)|
| Coin value falls | Not loose any value |![coinintable](draw/smiley_neutral.svg)|


- I do not want to sell the coin
- I want to protect myself against a loss due to falling gold prices
- I want to profit from a rising gold price 
- Is all of that possible? Yes, but I have to pay for it

---

# What is a Call Right?
## Contract on Coin Value: American Put Option

We enter a contract:
- I can pick any date within the next five years where you have to pay me the difference between the 680€ and the current price; e.g. if the value of the coin was 610€, you would pay me 680€ - 610€ = 70€
- I can only pick a date once, but I can choose any day within the five years
- This is called a call right or exercise right
- This specific contract is called an American Put Option
- How much should I pay / should you charge me for this contract?
- When should I exercise the option (which date should I choose)?

# What is a Call Right?
## American Put Option Payoff

![drawing](draw/american-option-payoff.svg)

- If the gold price rises, I will not exercise the option, i.e. I get a payoff of 0€
- If the gold price falls and the coin is worth x < 680€, I can can exercise the option and get the difference 680€ - x
- Expressing this in a common formula, the payoff of the option when exercising is
```
max(680€ - x, 0)
```

---

# What is a Call Right?
## Check of Requirements


| Scenario         | What I want         | Option Payoff | Coin Value + Option Payoff ||
|------------------|---------------------|---|---|---|
| Always           | Keep the coin       |||![check](draw/check.svg)|
| Coin value rises to x | Participate         |0€|x + 0€ = x > 680€|![check](draw/check.svg)|
| Coin value falls to x | Not loose any value |680€ - x|x + 680€ - x = 680€|![check](draw/check.svg)|

- I get to keep the coin
- If the gold price rises, my coin becomes more valuable and the option does nothing 
- If the gold price falls, my coin looses value, but I can exercise the option to make up for the loss

---

# What is a Call Right?
## American Put Option Exercise Decisions

![drawing](draw/american-option.svg)

- Whenever the coin value drops below 680€, I have to decide whether to exercise the option or hold and wait
- As long as the coin value is above 680€, I will hold

---

# Risk-Neutral Valuation using Monte Carlo Method

![drawing](draw/monte-carlo.svg)

- When using the Monte Carlo method, the coin value is simulated (sampled) independently many times
- Valuation happens by averaging payoffs over paths
- For example: (725€ + 710€ + 685€ + 670€ + 665€) / 5 = 3455 / 5 ≈ 680€

???

- With Monte Carlo method, model is simulated (sampled) many times
- Independent realizations of a stochastic process are called paths
- Each path can be seen as one possible future scenario
- All paths are equally likely
- Valuation happens by averaging payoffs over paths
- We know now how to evaluate payoffs; how can we handle call rights?

---

# Exercise vs. Continuation Value

![drawing](draw/exercise-or-continue.svg)

- Whenever the cashflow from exercising the put is larger than the continuation value, exercise is favourable
- As it can only be exercised once, it would be exercised on the first favourable exercise date

???

- To evaluate call rights, we have to compare two values:
- Exercise value and continuation value
- Exercise value is the cashflow we receive on exercising the option
- Continuation value is the value of the option if we do not exercise
- When exercise value is larger than continuation value we exercise, otherwise we don't
- How do we get exercise and continuation value?
- One is simple, the other one is hard

---

# Exercise Value

![small-img](img/monte-carlo.svg)
![small-img](img/exercise-value.svg)

Obtaining the exercise value is simple: just plug the underlying value (stock price) into the payoff function.

???

- On the left is the simulated stock price
- We simply plug the call price into the payoff formulate of the Put option and get the exercise value
- On the right we see the exercise value for all paths and timesteps
- We have to an approximation: we cannot simulate continuously in time, but only for discrete time steps
- Exercise value is simple, but how do we get continuation value?

---

# Perfect Foresight / Hindsight

![drawing](draw/perfect-foresight.svg)

???

- Let's first discuss an approach that does not work
- Can we simply use the future underlying values on a path to estimate the local continuation value?
- No, we would be looking into the future; we would over-estimate the options value
- Instead of the future values on the path we would need the **conditional expectation** given where we are

---

# Nested Simulation

![drawing](draw/nested-simulation.svg)

- With nested simulation, a new set of independent paths has to simulated for each existing path from the call right onwards
- The computational effort grows exponentially with the number of call rights

???

- Let's try it with brute force:
- For every path we perform a new set of simulations from the call right onwards
- This approach is called nested simulation because we nest one simulation into another
- This approach gives the correct result...
- ...but the computational effort **grows exponentially** with more call rights

# Approximation of Continuation Value

.center[Timeline chart with multiple paths goes here]

# Approximation of Continuation Value

![](img/continuation-value-cashflows.svg)

???

- Let's try to approximate the continuation value

---

# Approximation of Continuation Value

![](img/continuation-value-approximation.svg)

???

- Notice that we neither extrapolate nor interpolate with the fitted polynomial
- We only apply the fitted curve at points we used in the regression (in sample)
- We want to **smooth out the idioyncratic** information of each path...
- ...so that we do not use future information anymore
- This is a polynomial curve fitting problem and numpy gives us a nice tool to handle it...

---

# Polynomials in NumPy

```
import numpy as np
from numpy.polynomial import Polynomial
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.array([0., 1., 2., 3., 4., 5., 6., 7., 8., 9., 10.])
y = np.array([0., -1., -1.4, -1.6, -1.2, -0.5, 0.9, 1.6, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3])
p = Polynomial.fit(x, y, 4)

plt.figure(figsize=[6, 3]); plt.plot(*p.linspace(), '-'); plt.plot(x, y, '+');
```

![](img/numpy-polynomials.svg)

???

```
plt.gca().set_position([0.08, 0.08, 0.9, 0.9])
plt.savefig('img/numpy-polynomials.svg')
```

- We now have all the tools and prerequsites to do the algorithm

---

# Longstaff-Schwartz Algorithm in Python

```
# simulated paths as array of shape (60, 50) representing (timesteps, paths)
X = np.array([[...], ...])
strike = 1.0

# given no prior exercise we just receive the payoff of a European option
cashflow = np.maximum(strike - X[-1, :], 0.0)
# iterating backwards in time 
for i in reversed(range(1, X.shape[0] - 1)):
    x = X[i, :]
    # exercise value for time t[i]
    exercise = np.maximum(strike - x, 0.0)
    # boolean index of all in-the-money paths
    itm = exercise > 0.0
    # fit polynomial of degree 2
    fitted = Polynomial.fit(x[itm], cashflow[itm], 2)
    # approximate continuation value
    continuation = fitted(x)
    # boolean index where exercise is beneficial
    ex_idx = itm & (exercise > continuation)
    # update cashflows with early exercises
    cashflow[ex_idx] = exercise[ex_idx]
```

???

- We initialize the cashflow array with the payoff at maturity (at the last time step)
- Then we work backwards in a loop
- Discounting is ignored (i.e. interest rates are assumed to be zero)
- In the end we have the cashflow at the first time step with an exercise right; we now only need to discount to today and average
- Let's look at the data this algorithm generates...

---

# Approximated Continuation and Exercise Value III

![](img/approximated-continuation-and-exercise-value-2.svg)

???

- Closer to now we see no favourable exercises at all
- Let's now see when the algorithm recommends us to exercise...

# First Favourable Exercise

![](img/first-exercises.svg)

---

# Exercise Boundary

![](img/binomial-fitted-exercise-boundary.svg)

???

- I have tried to fit a curve as a simple exercise boundary, but the results do not look promising
- We are approaching the end, just a few words about generalization of the code...

---

# More Complex Call Rights

- Sometimes there is no concept of "in-the-money" paths; if exercise might be favourable on all paths, regression should be performed on all paths
- If the payoff depends on more than a single state variable, regression should be performed on basis functions of all state variables (and their interactions to a limited degree)
- If the payoff us path-dependent (non-Markovian), we have to evaluate the exercise/payoff function on the entire path up to the current time step
